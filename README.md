# Solidity
This repository contains projects and exercises I have completed in Solidity (object-oriented programming language for implementing smart contracts on various blockchain platforms, most notably, Ethereum).

## [Supply Chain App](https://github.com/lukehengstenberg/solidity/tree/main/SupplyChainApp)
Decentralized Suppy Chain Application which enables minting and distribution of ERC20 tokens, and tracking of products and product ownership for a supply chain. 

## [Reentrancy Attack](https://github.com/lukehengstenberg/solidity/tree/main/Bay%20Fountain%20Attack)
Demonstration of how a Reentrancy attack can be conducted against a vulnerable contract.

## [Charity Donation](https://github.com/lukehengstenberg/solidity/tree/main/Charity%20Donation)
Contracts which can be used by a charity to accept donations in ETH and distribute to a specific beneficiary address.

## [Proposal Voting](https://github.com/lukehengstenberg/solidity/tree/main/Proposal%20Voting)
Contract which can be deployed by a "chairperson" to enable certain "citizen" ETH addresses to vote on different proposals, calculating which proposal has the most votes, and whether a specific proposal has been successful.
